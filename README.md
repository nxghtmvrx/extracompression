##ExtraCompression- 59049 times better!
Single solution for your compressed needs. Simple(both inside and outside) mod about item compression.
Block frames represent villager badges(stone, iron, gold, diamond, emerald).

See [license](LICENSE)

In frames directory lies two types of frames that should be applied to blocks for each tier('x'- block color, 'x_'- basic color), plus charcoal because originally I wanted to add that block so frame was made just in case.
Frames made out of their respective resource blocks(redstone uses second pixel instead of the first as that one used in basic).
If there were any reason to have more than five tiers it would be `stone>coal>copper>iron>lapis>gold>redstone>diamond>emerald`.

This mod should work on nearly any version and porting it would be trivial.
